# AM_WINC1500

This is an Arduino library to work with Arduino Manager app available for iOS and macOS.

 * Supported Boards: Any AVR board with WINC1500 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2999)
 * Protocolo: WiFi
 
**Since this library uses EEPROM to store alarms information, cannot used with SAMD boards. In that case use the AM_ZEROWINC1500C instead.**

## Arduino Manager

Arduino Manager allows you to control and receive data from any Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller. It provides:

* More than 30 widgets (switch, knob, slider, display, gauge, bar, etc.) you can choose from
* A Code Generator to generate Arduino code quickly and easily
